## Why use a CDN?
Content Delivery Network (CDN) increases content availability and redundancy while reducing bandwidth costs and improving security. Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance as users receive content from data centers close to them and our servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfill.


## What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content and other media to users based on their geographic location. The primary goal of a CDN is to reduce latency and improve the load time of web pages by serving content from a server that is geographically closer to the user.

## Examples

1. **Video Streaming Services**  
   Services like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video use CDNs to deliver video content to users. A CDN caches videos at multiple locations across the globe, ensuring that users stream content from a server close to their location.

   This reduces buffering, improves streaming quality, and ensures smoother video playback even during peak times.

2. **Online Learning Platforms**  
   Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Khan Academy offer video lectures and interactive courses to millions of students worldwide. To ensure a smooth learning experience, CDNs are used to deliver video content, quizzes, and other resources.

   - Video content and course materials are cached across CDN nodes, allowing students to access course content faster, regardless of where they are.
   - Interactive features like quizzes or assignments load quicker due to localized content delivery.

3. **Social Media Platforms**  
   Social media giants like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter handle massive amounts of multimedia content (photos, videos, and live streams). These platforms need to deliver this content to users in near real-time, across diverse geographies and network conditions.

   - When users upload images or videos, CDNs cache and distribute these across global servers.
   - This ensures that users, regardless of their location, get fast access to these media files.
   - Live video streaming benefits immensely from CDN support, as edge servers help in reducing latency for viewers.



The main function of a CDN is to deliver content (such as images, videos, HTML, JavaScript, and more) to users based on their location, ensuring faster load times and better performance.

### Key Components of a CDN:

1. **Edge Servers:**  
   These are the geographically distributed servers that cache content closer to the user's location. When a user requests content, it is delivered from the nearest edge server.

2. **Origin Server:**  
   This is the main server where the original content resides. When content is updated or not available in the edge servers, the origin server supplies it.

3. **Caching:**  
   CDNs cache content such as images, videos, and other files in edge servers. Once cached, users can access this content faster without having to fetch it from the origin server every time.

4. **Load Balancing:**  
   CDNs distribute incoming user requests across multiple servers to reduce the load on any single server, ensuring smoother performance and reliability.

### How It Works:

1. **User Request:**
   - A user requests content by visiting a website or streaming a video.
   - The request is routed to the nearest CDN edge server based on the user’s geographic location.

2. **Content Delivery:**
   - If the content is cached on the edge server, it is immediately delivered to the user.
   - If the content is not cached or is outdated, the edge server fetches it from the origin server, caches it for future use, and then serves it to the user.

3. **Continuous Caching:**
   - The content remains cached in the edge servers for a specific duration (as per caching rules) and is delivered to users who request the same content.
   - As new content is generated, CDNs ensure the cached copies are updated or replaced.


## Benefits of Using a CDN

1. **Reduced Latency**:
   - By serving content from a location closer to the user, CDNs significantly reduce the time it takes for content to load.

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Faster load times lead to better performance, enhancing user experience and engagement.

3. **Scalability**:
   - CDNs can handle large volumes of traffic and scale to accommodate sudden spikes in demand, such as during major events or product launches.

4. **Reliability**:
   - With multiple servers distributed globally, CDNs provide redundancy and failover options, ensuring high availability and uptime.

5. **Offloading Traffic**:
   - By offloading traffic from the origin server to edge servers, CDNs reduce the load on the origin server, preventing it from becoming overwhelmed.

6. **Security**:
   - CDNs can provide additional security features, such as DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and web application firewalls (WAFs).

## Push vs Pull CDN

## Types of CDNs

CDNs can be broadly categorized into two main types: **Push CDNs** and **Pull CDNs**. Each type has its own methods for handling and delivering content, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs of the website or service.

### 1. Push CDNs

**Definition:**  
Push CDNs involve manually uploading content to the CDN servers. When new content is available or existing content changes, it is pushed to the CDN servers. The CDN then serves this content to users.

**How It Works:**
- **Content Upload:** Content is uploaded directly to the CDN's edge servers. This involves pushing content from the origin server to the CDN.
- **URL Rewriting:** URLs on the website are updated to point to the CDN locations where the content is stored.
- **Expiration and Updates:** You can configure when content should expire or be refreshed, managing how often the CDN content is updated.

**Steps**:


- You prepare your website’s static assets, such as product images (e.g., product1.jpg, product2.jpg), promotional banners, and downloadable PDF brochures.

- Using the CDN provider’s dashboard or API, you upload these static assets to the CDN’s edge servers. You might use a tool or script provided by the CDN to automate this process.
Example: You upload product1.jpg, product2.jpg, and brochure.pdf to the CDN.

- Update your website to use the CDN URLs for these assets instead of hosting them on your origin server. For instance, instead of linking to http://yourwebsite.com/images/product1.jpg, you would use http://cdn.yourcdnprovider.com/images/product1.jpg.

- Configure cache settings on the CDN. You might set rules to cache these images and PDFs for a specific period, such as 30 days, before checking for updates.
Example: You configure the CDN to cache images for 30 days and the brochure for 15 days.
Content Delivery:

- When users visit your website, their browsers request images and other assets from the CDN. The CDN’s edge servers serve these assets from locations close to the users, reducing load times.
Example: A user in New York requests product1.jpg. The request is routed to the nearest CDN edge server in New York, which serves the image quickly.

- When you update your website (e.g., replacing product1.jpg with a new version), you push the new image to the CDN. The CDN updates the cached version according to the cache expiration settings.
Example: You upload a new product1.jpg to the CDN. The CDN replaces the old cached version with the new one.

**Benefits:**
- **Control:** You have full control over what content is pushed to the CDN and can set specific rules for content expiration.
- **Efficient for Static Content:** Ideal for sites with a small amount of content or infrequently updated content, as the CDN stores the content in its cache without needing to frequently pull new data from the origin server.

**Use Cases:**
- **Low Traffic Sites:** Suitable for websites with low to moderate traffic where content updates are less frequent.
- **Stable Content:** Effective for static websites or applications with content that does not change often.



### 2. Pull CDNs

**Definition:**  
Pull CDNs update their cache based on user requests. When a user requests content, the CDN checks if it has the content in its cache. If not, it fetches the content from the origin server, caches it, and then delivers it to the user.

**How It Works:**
- **Content Fetching:** When a request is made for content that is not currently cached, the CDN fetches it from the origin server.
- **Caching:** The fetched content is then cached on the CDN’s edge servers for future requests.
- **Cache Updates:** The CDN cache is updated automatically based on user requests, reducing the need for manual content management.

You operate a news website that publishes articles, images, and videos throughout the day. Content updates frequently as new articles are published and old ones are archived. You need a solution that handles high traffic and dynamic content updates efficiently.

Steps:


- A user visits your news website and requests to view an article or image. This request is initially directed to the CDN.

- The Pull CDN checks if the requested content is already cached on its edge servers. If it is, the content is served directly to the user from the edge server.

- If the content is not in the cache or is outdated, the CDN fetches it from your origin server. The origin server provides the latest version of the content.

- The CDN caches the fetched content on its edge servers for subsequent requests and delivers it to the user. The cached version will be used for future requests until it expires or is refreshed.

- The CDN automatically handles cache updates based on user requests. When content changes on the origin server, the CDN fetches the updated version as needed.

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Less manual intervention is required since the CDN automatically updates its cache based on incoming requests.
- **Scalability:** Ideal for sites with high traffic or dynamic content where managing frequent content updates manually would be impractical.

**Use Cases:**
- **High Traffic Sites:** Best for websites with heavy traffic, as it helps distribute load and manage content delivery efficiently.
- **Dynamic Content:** Suitable for sites where content changes frequently or where it is impractical to push updates manually.

### Comparison

**Push CDNs vs. Pull CDNs:**


- **Maintenance:** Push CDNs require manual content management, while Pull CDNs automate content updates.
- **Traffic Handling:** Pull CDNs are better suited for high traffic and dynamic content due to their automatic cache updating.
- **Content Types:** Push CDNs work well for static content with infrequent updates, while Pull CDNs are ideal for dynamic content with frequent changes.



### Disadvantages and caveats

Disadvantages:


- The first request for a new or updated content might experience higher latency as the CDN fetches the content from the origin server.

- Managing cache expiration and invalidation can be challenging. If not configured properly, users might see outdated content.

- In cases of sudden traffic spikes, the CDN might need to frequently fetch content from the origin server, which can impact performance and increase origin server load.

- Setting up and configuring cache rules, expiration times, and handling edge cases might require careful planning and management.

- If the origin server experiences issues or downtime, the CDN will not be able to fetch and deliver content, potentially affecting availability.
