## 1. Availability

**Definition:**  
Availability measures how often a system is operational and accessible. It is often expressed as a percentage of uptime over a specific period.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Uptime:** The total time a system is functioning correctly.
- **Downtime:** The total time a system is not functioning.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Defines the expected availability and performance targets between service providers and customers.

**Common Metrics:**

- **99.9% Availability (Three Nines):** Allows for about 8.76 hours of downtime per year.
- **99.99% Availability (Four Nines):** Allows for about 52.6 minutes of downtime per year.
- **99.999% Availability (Five Nines):** Allows for about 5.26 minutes of downtime per year.

**Strategies to Improve Availability:**

- **Failover Systems:** Automatically switch to a backup system in case of failure.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Continuously monitor system performance and alert administrators to potential issues.
