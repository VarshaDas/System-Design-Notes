##  Redundancy

**Definition:**  
Redundancy involves having additional or duplicate components within a system to ensure it continues to function if a primary component fails. It is a key strategy to achieve high availability.

**Types of Redundancy:**

- **Hardware Redundancy:** Using multiple physical components, such as additional servers or disks, to prevent failure. Examples include RAID configurations and redundant power supplies.
- **Network Redundancy:** Multiple network paths or devices to ensure continued connectivity if one path fails. Examples include having multiple ISPs or routers.
- **Data Redundancy:** Storing copies of data in multiple locations or formats to prevent data loss. Examples include database replication and backup systems.

**Common Redundancy Configurations:**

- **Active-Passive:** One component (active) handles all the load, while the other (passive) remains idle until needed.
- **Active-Active:** Multiple components handle load simultaneously, providing both performance benefits and failover capability.
