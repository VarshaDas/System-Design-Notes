## Reliability

**Definition:**  
Reliability refers to the ability of a system to consistently perform its intended functions without failure over a specified period. It measures the likelihood that a system will continue to operate correctly.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** Average time between system failures.
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** Average time taken to repair a system after a failure.
- **Failure Rate:** The frequency of system failures over time.

**Factors Affecting Reliability:**

- **Design Quality:** Well-designed systems with proper testing and validation tend to be more reliable.
- **Maintenance:** Regular updates and proactive maintenance can help improve reliability.
- **Component Quality:** Using high-quality components reduces the likelihood of failures.

**Improving Reliability:**

- **Redundancy:** Implementing redundancy to prevent single points of failure.
- **Testing and Validation:** Thorough testing under various conditions to ensure the system behaves as expected.
- **Monitoring and Analytics:** Continuously monitoring system performance and analyzing failures to prevent future issues.
